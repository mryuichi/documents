<h3>Fujitsu Limited</h3>   
<p>Fujitsu supports this specifications to connect any kinds of devices used in a various fields and to lead them to 
  operate from the cloud services. The proxy servient can makes the devices easily join to the WoT world. It can provide 
  adaptation functionality to convert proprietary interface of them to WoT interface.</p>
<h4 id="impl-fujitsu-node-red">Node-RED including Node generators from the proxy: TD Consumer</h4>
<p>The pre-proccesing mechanism for Node-RED is supported to generate the nodes from the TDs of the shadow devices 
  on the proxy servient. This offers a good application development enviromnent to quickly set up. This is composed of 
  a retriever of TDs on the proxy and a node generator that Hitachi implemented.</p>
<h4 id="impl-fujitsu-WoT-sensors">WoT sensors: TD Procuder</h4>
<p>The WoT sernsors includes a Wi-Fi communication unit that has a WoT stack on it and easily make compatible WoT devices 
  using sensors units. This communciaton unit has a common interface like I2C and GPIO for the connections.</p>
<h4 id="impl-fujitsu-legacy-adapter">Legacy devices with adapters: TD Procuder</h4>
<p>Home appliances and facilities like window blinds in the smart home can be connected with adapters to convert the 
  propriety interface like ECHONET Lite to WoT. Rotating light that has EtherCAT interface can be done in the same way.</p>
<h4 id="impl-fujitsu-proxy">Proxy servient: TD Producer and Consumer</h4>
<p>Fujitsu proxy servient is implemented by JAVA and have an API similar to Scritping API. It provides the interface to develop
  the device interface adapter to WoT. These adapters can be attached and deattached easily using with OSGi framework from the 
  operators. A device interface adaper is provided as a OSGi bundle deveopped by JAVA and installed to the proxy servient before
  the device to be connected. If a device has been connected to the proxy, a shadow device and its TD correspoinding to the device 
  is generated on it.</p>
  <p>If 2 proxy servient are set up on a local network and the internet, they can cooperate with each other to go through
  a firewall to establish a connection with applications on the internet and devices on the local network. In the WoT plugfest, 
  Fujitsu set up the remote proxy servient on the internet and the local proxy servients on the local networks in the smart home
  and at the places the plugfests were held.</p>
