## Proxy integration scenarios

Scenario 1: Home sensors and appliances integrated with proxies

### Description:
Fujitsu will provide 2 local proxies and 1 remote proxy Servient. One local proxy is in the smart home in Japan and 
connected with some sensors and appliacnces. Another local proxy is in the Lyon and can be connected with 
the participants home devices. The remote proxy Servient is connected with these 2 local proxy and provide WoT interface
to control the devices connected with these 2 local proxies.
In this scenario, the application connected to the remote proxy can monitor the sensors in the smart home and 
detect when something changes with the sensors. These changes make one or more operations to the appliances.

### Device interactions
- Turn on the room light (Fujitsu)
- Detect when the room becomes bright (Fujitsu)
- Close the window blind (Fujitsu)
- Turn on the air conditioner (Fujitsu)
- Detect when the sensors in the room change (???)
- Trun on something (???)

We hope this sequence of device interactions is made longer. Please add your device interactions to this.

Scenario 2: Industrial sensors and facilities integrated with proxies

### Description

### Device interactions
- Detect when the dust in the room increases (Fujitsu)
- Turn on the lotating light (fujitsu)
- Detect when some sensors change (???)
- Turn on something (???)
