## Proxy integration scenarios

Scenario 2: Detections and actuations in the home

### Description:
There are some sensors and actuators in the home. If a sensor detects changes in the home such as brightness, 
the smart home application controls some home appliances such as room light. In this demonstration, when the application
turns on the room light, the illumination sensor detects when the room becomes bright and another room light is turned on.
As as a result, the illumination sensor in this room detects to become bright and the light in the third room is turned on.
This application monitors some sensors in the same time and controls the light correspoinding to the sensor.<br>
In this demonstration, all sensors and lights are connected to the local proxies the cloud application control 
these devices using the remote proxy.

### Device interactions
- Turn on the room light (Fujitsu)
- Detect when the room becomes bright (Fujitsu)
- Turn on the light (Intel)
- Detect when the room become bright (Intel)
- Turn on the light (SmartThings)
- detect when the room become bright (SmartThings)
- Turn off the room light (Fujitsu)
- detect when the room become dark (Fujitsu)
- turn off the room light (Intel)
- detect when the room becomes dark (Intel)
- turn off the room light (SmartThings)
- detect when the room becomes darks (SmartThings)


Scenario 2: Industrial sensors and facilities integrated with proxies

### Description

### Device interactions
- Detect when the dust in the room increases (Fujitsu)
- Turn on the lotating light (fujitsu)
- Detect when some sensors change (???)
- Turn on something (???)
